      <description><![CDATA[<p>
This was an okay month.
Unfortunately I haven't made much progress on my goals since February.
I have my reasons but I don't want to go into it too much.
I talk a bit about it in the productivity section though.
For those same reasons, there's no March review.
I'm fully back now so May should be a good month.
</p>
<div id="outline-container-health" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="health">Health</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
According to my spreadsheet I have gained 0.9KG.
I'm not happy with this but clearly I can't be doing what I've been
doing.
I am already exercising so I'll be doing a full overhaul of my diet instead.
My current diet is a combination of food from my mother's restaurant and
food I order from other restaurants I like.
I'll be dusting off my recipe book and start cooking for myself more.
Mentally, I am better.
I'm more relaxed and happier in general and I intend to keep it that
way.

<p>
I was productive in the sense that I did a lot of things.
Most of it was client work but I'm done with most of that now.
I had a negative experience with a client and I've learned a lot from
it.
So I won't be taking any client work until I've documented what I
learned and incorporate it into how I will handle future clients.
In terms of my actions below, I was 0% productive.
That will change this month.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
This was a rough month.
I said yes to too many things.
I was overwhelmed and my sleep was poor.
Understandably, my productivity and habits suffered.
As did my physical and mental health.
</p>
<div id="outline-container-health" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="health">Health</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
According to my spreadsheet I have lost exactly 1KG.
It's better than last month, but it's not great in the grand scheme of
things.
I didn't exercise consistently and I regularly pulled all-nighters.
On the bright side, I can do pushups now.

<div id="outline-container-productivity" class="outline-2">

I was more productive than last month.
However, most of my time was spent on client work and not my personal
projects or digital products.
Going forward I will be saying no to most client work.
I'll also be decreasing the limit of the projects I can take on to one
from three.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
This was a decent month.
In general, things went better than I expected but it could have been better.
I gained weight, which I don't like but I don't want to be too quick to
judge since I have been exercising.
My mental health on the other hand is great.
My productivity still needs some work and I have made zero progress on
the relationships end.
My income has increased but I have made no progress in my other skills.
I can only hope things will go the same or better next month.
</p>
<div id="outline-container-health" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="health">Health</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
According to my spreadsheet I have gained 0.6KG.
Not good.
My diet hasn't been the best so I think I will have to make more
aggressive changes.
I have exercised consistently since 05/01/2025. On some days, I really
did not feel like exercising but I did it anyway.
I'm surprised I haven't missed a day since I started.
My mental health has been fine.
It was hard to get through some days but usually after a few days, I
felt good again.

The plan was to focus on personal projects but life happens.
This month I've had more work than I know what to do with.
So my main focus has been client work and my job.
I am productive but I've noticed there's a lot of wasted time.
One of the things I'm going to be doing is trying to notice in the
moment and get back to work.

three and never got back on.

just be an excuse.
I could have made time and I will.

The main goal here was to double my income and I'm happy to say that I'm
more than halfway there. I got a raise at work which helped a lot so now
all I have to do is to increase my other income sources and I should be
good.
On starting a business, I'm not sure how I feel about this now because
multiple people are trying to start a business with me and I'm not sure
if it counts if I don't own all of the business.
I'll think more about that and report next month.

quiver of each of them. He does little himself. He only plans.

<p>
The general idea this year is to make and do things.
I plan a lot but I end up finishing very little. 
As such, I've decided to reduce the amount of things I do so that I can
finish more things.
This time, I will share the actions for each section.

<p>
My weight is the main problem here, so the main thing I will be focusing
on this year is my diet and eating habits. Exercise will be a secondary
focus and I'm sure it'll also help a bit. The main reason I'm including
exercise is that it makes me feel good.

I've always known that willpower is finite but I acted as if mine wasn't.
Limiting the things I do within a day has been helpful so I'm going to
keep doing that.
The main thing I will be focusing on here is finishing personal
projects. 
Last year I started more than twenty personal projects but I finished
maybe two. 
I'm going to try to not start any more personal projects and finish some
of the current projects instead.

I spent a lot of time programming last year.
Most of it was not focused practice or learning though, I was just
trying to get things to work.
I learned new programming languages but I'm still not good at any of
them.
I started learning OCaml for advent of code so I'll still keep learning
that but I won't be learning any new programming languages this year.

This year I want to spend more time with people I care about.
There are a lot of cool people I know that I want to be closer to but I
didn't make time for them.
On the romantic side, I wasn't as proactive as I could've been so I'm
going to do that this year.

This list seems more doable than what I had last year. I also made the
mistake of adding some goals to my plans but because they weren't very
actionable I didn't <i>do</i> anything.
</p>


<p>
There are other things I want to do but they don't fit properly into any
of the categories and some are a bit sensitive so I'll keep those to
myself.
If I end up doing them, I will post about it on <a href="https://x.com/lawrencelogoh">my Twitter</a> and/or

Happy New Year.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
The general plan this year was to get good. I made detailed plans that I
followed to the best of my ability but unfortunately, I didn't reach
most of my goals. I bit off more than I could chew.
</p>
<div id="outline-container-health" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="health">Health</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
I created a workout routine and made time for it.
The problem was, I had to actually workout.
I worked out sometimes but most of the time I didn't.
Mentally, I'm doing better than I was last year.
I'm less anxious and my baseline happiness is still high so I'm good on
this front.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-productivity" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="productivity">Productivity</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
The goal was to create habits that will make me more productive.
I definitely created habits.
The problem was, I created too much.
This led to me not following them at all in some cases.
It's an improvement from last year but I could have been better.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-programming" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="programming">Programming</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
I feel like I got better at programming, but I don't have much to show
for it.
I don't remember how many personal projects I started but I didn't
finish any of them.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-money" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="money">Money</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
I made more money this year than I did last year.
I didn't get to an average of $2000 a month but it's an improvement.
One thing I decided halfway through the year was to stop talking about
money.
I've found that people get really weird when money comes up so for now
I won't be talking about concrete numbers.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-relationships" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="relationships">Relationships</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
I made some new friends this year and I put more effort into maintaining
the relationships that I have.
Still no dice in the romantic department but I'll keep trying.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-knowledge" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="knowledge">Knowledge</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
I learned a lot about a lot of different things. I also made some
decisions on how I'm going to document some of these things.
Most of them will go into my zettelkasten but for other things they will
go into my Knowledge Management System.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-skills" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
The goal here was to focus on Graphic Design and UI/UX.
I tried to do too much here and I've learned my lesson.
I'm going to take it one at a time from now on.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-conclusion" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
This was a good year.
I didn't do everything I wanted to but I've learned a lot about myself
and I'm going to try to work with what I have instead of trying to
brute force everything.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
The plan this year is to get good.
I'm okay at a few things, but I need to get really good.
I will write a detailed list of actions I will need to do to make this
year a success but I'm not sure if I'll release it publicly or not. 
We'll see.
</p>
<div id="outline-container-health" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="health">Health</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
This is going to be one of my main priorities this year.
The goal here is to lose weight and get in shape. 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
A healthy mind resides in a healthy body 
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
My mental health isn't a big priority this year.
I have a high baseline of happiness so we can leave that for another time. 
This doesn't mean I will be neglecting it but it won't be a high priority.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-productivity" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="productivity">Productivity</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
My system is at a place that I'm really happy with. 
The focus now is to be to build habits that will help me be more productive. 
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-relationships" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="relationships">Relationships</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
A lot of progress was made last year but there is still more to be made.
The goal is to be more proactive and not just leave things to chance.
Yes, this applies to romantic relationships as well. 
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-programming" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="programming">Programming</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
I've done a lot of learning when it comes to programming but very little doing.
I'm still going to be learning but I'll be writing a lot of <del>bad</del> software so that I can get better.

</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-money" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="money">Money</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">

<h2 id="other-skills">Other skills</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">

This year, the main focus is on design. Mainly graphic design and UI/UX design.
I will focus on writing and making music with a DAW as well.

The plan this year was to play to my strengths and work on my weaknesses. I ended up doing both very poorly.
</p>
<div id="outline-container-productivity" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="productivity">Productivity</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
My Life Management System(LMS) is at the point where I can see myself using it for the rest of my life. It's very simple and doesn't really depend on any tools even though I only use it with emacs.
</p>

<p>
There are a few issues like, using it on mobile but I think I can find an app that works reasonably well or make one.
</p>

<p>
My productivity itself has been boosted. Not only because of the system but because I pushed myself and realised what I was capable of. 
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-relationships" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="relationships">Relationships</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
I made a lot of progress here. I called people I care about a few times. Made time to just hang out where just being around friends was the goal. I checked on people a few times as well.
</p>

<p>
In terms of romantic relationships, I tried. I generally don't try but I tried this time. I was unsuccessful but I learned a lot not just about what I like but about the kind of person I am. 
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-programming" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="programming">Programming</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
So I programmed a lot this year. More than I did last year. But I didn't do exactly what I planned to do.
</p>

<p>
I planned to get better at Python and Go and try out Rust and Zig. I got a job where I mainly work with JavaScript so that became my main focus. I did learn Python and Go but not as much as I had planned to.
</p>

<p>
I didn't even touch Rust and Zig. I did do some mobile development but no OS development. 
</p>

<p>
I'm not happy with how this went, but I'll try again next year.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-money" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="money">Money</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
I didn't get to my goal of $2000/month. I have however moved from making $0 to a respectable amount. 
</p>

<p>
I've also had to think about money a lot<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>. I've decided that I want a lot of it now and I'm going to try everything I can to get it without compromising my morals or ethics.

<div id="outline-container-other-skills" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="other-skills">Other skills</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
I'm not sure if my writing has improved or not. What I do know is that I'm not yet good enough so I'm going to keep trying.
</p>

<p>
I haven't practised drawing enough but I am practising. 
</p>

<p>
I didn't buy an electric guitar but I have started learning how to use a DAW to make music. Music is the hardest thing I've had to learn so far but I will keep trying.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
Growing up, I've always had a unique relationship with money. While I
didn't grow up "rich", money was never a thing I had to think
about. Sometimes I got what I wanted, other times my parents told me it
was outside of their budget and I understood(even if I was mad).  
</p>
<div id="outline-container-early-perspective-on-programming-and-money" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="early-perspective-on-programming-and-money">Early Perspective on Programming and Money</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
I don't think I'm unique in feeling like this, but some part of me felt
like trying to make money with programming was bad. It felt like
programming with the express goal of making money was bad. In my mind,
programming was this pure "thing" and using it solely to pursue money
dirtied it. I even saw people who did that as dirty as well.  
</p>

<p>
Sure they could do what they wanted but I cringed whenever they would
call themselves programmers or god forbid "software engineers" because
they weren't "real programmers" <del>like me</del>.  
</p>

<p>
Keep in mind, this is me at around fourteen years old. Eleven years have
passed since then and I've changed a lot. I've come to understand that
wanting to make a lot of money isn't a bad thing. If programming helps
someone achieve that, then more power to them.  
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-reflection-on-pieter-levels-article" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="reflection-on-pieter-levels-article">Reflection on Pieter Levels' Article</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
A few days ago I read an article by Pieter Levels titled <a href="https://levels.io/how-i-build-my-minimum-viable-products/">"How I build my
minimum viable products"</a>. I read it because I've been thinking about
ways to make money with programming and he seemed to be good at doing
just that. I think it's a helpful article and if you want to do a
similar thing to what he's doing, go read it.  
</p>

<p>
While reading the article, two sentences caught my attention.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Programming is not my passion. Making stuff is my passion.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I felt a little uncomfortable reading that. The making stuff part I can
understand because, of course, I want to make stuff, but I think I still
agreed with fourteen-year-old me on some level. So I decided to sit down
and think about why it made me feel uncomfortable beyond it dirtying
programming and I came up with an answer that felt right. 
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-changing-perspective" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="changing-perspective">Changing Perspective</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<blockquote>
<p>
Should I sell out?
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It felt like an either or choice. One thing that helped me
changed my perspective was this stream by George Hotz titled
[[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2bXEUSAiTI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2bXEUSAiTI</a>]["what is programming?
(noob lessons!)]"].  
</p>

<p>
In the stream, he makes a distinction between a thing he calls "High Brow
Software Engineering" and another he calls "Translating business
requirements into code". We call both of them programming but they're
different things. I think the latter is self explanatory but the former
is best explained by George
<a href="https://youtu.be/N2bXEUSAiTI?si=ghH_2nW3MVSWIfJk&amp;t=1260">here</a>. 
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-conclusion" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
The conclusion I came to was that I can do both. One can be a thing I do
for work and the other can be something I do for fun. The thing that I
will keep in mind is that while I am "selling out" I'm still going to be
selective in the things that I build. I'm not going to build yet another
AI tool that uses OpenAI's APIs in a really basic way for example.  
</p>

<p>
While the things I'm passionate about may not bring money in the short
term, I think I should still do them because I enjoy them. On the other
hand, I need money so I will "sell out" at least for a time and create
products that people want to use. The hope will be that in the future I
can spend more time on the programming I enjoy and less time on the one
I don't enjoy.  
</p>

<p>
From now on you'll be seeing a lot of projects that I will be working
on. Some of them will be products designed to make me money and some
will be things I think are cool. While I'm doing this, I will be on the
lookout for something that is both fun and profitable.  
</p>

<p>
Hopefully I find it.

      <title>Plans for 2023</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
The basic idea behind this year is to play to my strengths and work on my weaknesses. Min-maxing essentially. 
A lot of these things are not checklist items that I can just list and tick off.
They require step-by-step plans which I will make and follow.
</p>
<div id="outline-container-productivity" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="productivity">Productivity</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
I already have a system that I use to manage my life. It's just a folder of org files that I like to call my LMS(Life Management System).
I plan to rethink and clearly define this system and some of the other systems that I use in conjunction with it.
I think doing that will boost my productivity.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-relationships" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="relationships">Relationships</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
When it comes to relationships, I'm very passive.
I generally don't call or text people until they call me and I don't check on people I care about.
When I talk to people about how they do it, they say it just comes naturally to them.
For whatever reason, that doesn't happen for me. But I want to do it, so I'm going to be more active and intentional about my relationships.
This will involve not only calling and checking on people more, but also planning and scheduling activities to spend more time with the people I care about.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-programming" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="programming">Programming</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
I know some programming languages but I don't think I know any of them well enough.
So the plan is to become good at two of them at least. 
Python and Go seem like the obvious choices so I'll go with them for now.
While I do that, I also plan to at least check out Rust and Zig and see how I like them.
When it comes to programming domains, I want to become a well-rounded backend developer and improve my frontend skills.
Beyond that, I will be trying out other domains like mobile development and OS development(for fun).
What this will generally look like is, building a lot of projects that are not necessarily useful to the general public. But if I can do that, I will.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-money" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="money">Money</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
I've lived a very comfortable life.
Because of that, I haven't had to think about money until now.
I want to do a lot of cool stuff but money seems to be the thing that I lack to do them.
So this year, I'm going to focus on making money.
My humble goal, for now, is at least an average income of $2000/month by the end of the year.
I know I can make more than that, but I live in Ghana, and most employers don't pay that much.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-other-skills" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="other-skills">Other skills</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
As you can already tell, my writing is shit. 
I want to write a book next year about a concept I'm chewing on, so it has to be improved.
Another big one is some type of artistic outlet that is not writing. The ones I'm most attracted to right now are drawing and the electric guitar. 
</p>

<p>
This is a non-exhaustive list but these are the non-negotiables. They come first before everything else.
</p>

<p>
Happy New Year.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
Overall, this was a good year.
Unfortunately, I wasn't as productive as I had hoped to be.
But, I learned a lot about myself and I made progress.
</p>

<p>
I started learning Go and C, started some new projects, and even lost some weight.
I also made some new friends along the way.
</p>

<p>
While I'm happy with how the year went in general, I can't help but feel like I could have done more.
</p>

<p>
One of the big things I tried to learn was to not take things too seriously.
It would feel like the world was ending if I forgot about some homework, for example.
I feel like I took it a bit too far, but I think I'm ready to try a more <b>balanced</b> approach.
</p>

<p>
I have a good feeling about next year.

      <title>Building a static site generator</title>
      <link>/blog/building-a-static-site-generator.html</link>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
What I was using is <a href="https://github.com/lawrencelogoh/lawrencelogoh.github.io/blob/921d8d1012f73c6298b7d5412404b0f7b2a33ed/build">a badly written bash script that depends on pup and pandoc</a>.
I don't mind the pandoc dependency too much as I have it on all my systems anyway. 
But the script is messy and I'd rather have something cleaner.
</p>
<div id="outline-container-why-not-just-use-x" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="why-not-just-use-x">"Why not just use x?"</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
Most of the static site generators I've seen like Hugo and Jekyll seem too complicated for me.
I'm not saying I can't use them, I just felt some friction and thought it would be cool to build my own.
</p>

<p>
My requirements for the current script were:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Must have as few dependencies as possible.</li>
<li>Must work on UNIX/UNIX-like systems</li>
<li>Must generate an RSS file with all blog posts</li>
<li>Must arrange blog posts by date</li>
</ul>

<p>
I didn't put too much thought into how the old script worked.
I started by writing a function that compiles the markdown files of my blog posts.
Everything else came after that.
Whenever I hit a roadblock, I looked for a program that could help me.
In the end, I had a hacky script that worked but I wasn't proud of it.
I also started to run into problems when I wanted to add new functionality or change something.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/lawrencelogoh/lawrencelogoh.github.io/blob/9c27fe701fb522f936147f5ad5fbd01a02f7ad13/build">The current script</a> is not as bad.
The way that it works is, it assumes every directory(including the root directory) has an <code>src</code> subdirectory.
It compiles every markdown file in the <code>src</code> subdirectories to HTML files that live in the directory itself.
To get away with not creating an <code>index.html</code> I create an <code>index.md</code> instead and that gets compiled like every other markdown file.
That's the core of how it works.
If you want the details, read the script.
</p>


<p>
I'm happy with how it works right now but there's a minor annoyance I have with it.
The blog posts are arranged according to their dates by putting the date
in the file name.
</p>

<p>
<i>Yuck</i>.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
I tried using an associative array to do it at first, but I found it difficult to sort the dates with the sort program.
I'll figure it out eventually.
</p>


<p>
If you have any suggestions email me or send a pull request :).

I have since implemented what I call "ghetto sorting". It's not pretty but it works
