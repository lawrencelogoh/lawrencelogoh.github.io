<article>
<p>
The plan this year was to play to my strengths and work on my weaknesses. I ended up doing both very poorly.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-productivity" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="productivity">Productivity</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
My Life Management System(LMS) is at the point where I can see myself using it for the rest of my life. It's very simple and doesn't really depend on any tools even though I only use it with emacs.
</p>

<p>
There are a few issues like, using it on mobile but I think I can find an app that works reasonably well or make one.
</p>

<p>
My productivity itself has been boosted. Not only because of the system but because I pushed myself and realised what I was capable of. 
</p>

<div id="outline-container-relationships" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="relationships">Relationships</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
I made a lot of progress here. I called people I care about a few times. Made time to just hang out where just being around friends was the goal. I checked on people a few times as well.
</p>

<p>
In terms of romantic relationships, I tried. I generally don't try but I tried this time. I was unsuccessful but I learned a lot not just about what I like but about the kind of person I am. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-programming" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="programming">Programming</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
So I programmed a lot this year. More than I did last year. But I didn't do exactly what I planned to do.
</p>

<p>
I planned to get better at Python and Go and try out Rust and Zig. I got a job where I mainly work with JavaScript so that became my main focus. I did learn Python and Go but not as much as I had planned to.
</p>

<p>
I didn't even touch Rust and Zig. I did do some mobile development but no OS development. 
</p>

<p>
I'm not happy with how this went, but I'll try again next year.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-money" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="money">Money</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
I didn't get to my goal of $2000/month. I have however moved from making $0 to a respectable amount. 
</p>

<p>
I've also had to think about money a lot<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>. I've decided that I want a lot of it now and I'm going to try everything I can to get it without compromising my morals or ethics.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-other-skills" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="other-skills">Other skills</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
I'm not sure if my writing has improved or not. What I do know is that I'm not yet good enough so I'm going to keep trying.
</p>

<p>
I haven't practised drawing enough but I am practising. 
</p>

<p>
I didn't buy an electric guitar but I have started learning how to use a DAW to make music. Music is the hardest thing I've had to learn so far but I will keep trying.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-conclusion" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
Overall, this was a good year.
I'm not happy with how some things went, but I'll learn from it and try to make next year better.
