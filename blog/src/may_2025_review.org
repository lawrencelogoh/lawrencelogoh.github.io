This was a decent month.
I feel like I'm finally back to baseline.
There's still a lot of work to be done but I feel better physically and
mentally. 

* Health
According to my spreadsheet I've lost 1.5KG.
It's not ideal but it's a step in the right direction.
On average, I've been exercising about three days every week.
My diet is "fine" but I haven't been able to cook as much I wanted to.
It feels like I can't make time for it so I'll have to fix that.
* Productivity
A lot of my productivity was focused on work and client work once again.
The upside is that my relationship with my new client is much better.
It's hard to make time for my projects just because it feels like I
won't get anything in return.
** Actions progress
*** DOING Build three personal projects [0/3]
*** TODO Build three digital products [0/3]
* Programming
I moved the needle here but I might as well have done nothing.
I will have to find a way to make time for it.
** Actions progress
*** DONE Create leetcode habit in LMS
*** DOING Finish [[https://threejs-journey.com/][ThreeJS Journey]] course
*** TODO Finish programming boost
*** TODO Read [[https://interpreterbook.com/][Writing An Interpreter In Go]]
* Relationships
I haven't been as intentional about my relationships as I was at the
beginning of the year.
I'm not sure how to fix this but I'll be thinking about it.
Still no dice at the romantic side.
I haven't even asked anyone out yet.
** Actions progress
*** DOING Go out with friends at least ten times [1/10]
*** TODO Ask at most ten girls out on a date [0/10]
* Money
I /still/ haven't started my own business yet. But I know what I want to
do now at least. I've been torn between a SaaS and a service business
but I think I will go for a service business first.
From what I've learned, it's easier to get to the point where you're
bringing in cash with a service businesses compared to a SaaS, so I'll
go with that for now.
** Actions progress
*** DONE Create client acquisition habit in LMS
*** DONE Get a salary increase
*** DOING Start a business
* Other skills
I have made zero progress here again.
** Actions
*** DONE Create UI/UX Design learning habit in LMS
*** DONE Create Guitar learning habit in LMS
*** DOING Finish three design projects [0/3]
*** TODO Learn how to play three classical guitar pieces
