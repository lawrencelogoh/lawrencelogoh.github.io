This was a decent month.
In general, things went better than I expected but it could have been better.
I gained weight, which I don't like but I don't want to be too quick to
judge since I have been exercising.
My mental health on the other hand is great.
My productivity still needs some work and I have made zero progress on
the relationships end.
My income has increased but I have made no progress in my other skills.
I can only hope things will go the same or better next month.

* Health
According to my spreadsheet I have gained 0.6KG.
Not good.
My diet hasn't been the best so I think I will have to make more
aggressive changes.
I have exercised consistently since 05/01/2025. On some days, I really
did not feel like exercising but I did it anyway.
I'm surprised I haven't missed a day since I started.
My mental health has been fine.
It was hard to get through some days but usually after a few days, I
felt good again.

** Actions progress
*** DONE Create exercise habit in Life Management System(LMS)
*** DONE Create meditation habit in Life Management System(LMS)
*** DONE Create spreadsheet to track weight
*** DONE Start "weight loss" project

* Productivity
The plan was to focus on personal projects but life happens.
This month I've had more work than I know what to do with.
So my main focus has been client work and my job.
I am productive but I've noticed there's a lot of wasted time.
One of the things I'm going to be doing is trying to notice in the
moment and get back to work.

** Actions progress
*** DOING Finish three personal projects [0/3]
*** TODO Build three digital products
* Programming
I started strong in the first week but I feel off the wagon around week
three and never got back on. 
I could blame it on the fact that I have more work to do but that would
just be an excuse.
I could have made time and I will.
** Actions progress
*** DONE Create leetcode habit in LMS
*** DOING Finish [[https://threejs-journey.com/][ThreeJS Journey]] course
*** TODO Finish programming boost
*** TODO Read [[https://interpreterbook.com/][Writing An Interpreter In Go]]

* Relationships
I have made zero progress here.
** Actions progress
*** DOING Go out with friends at least ten times [0/10]
*** TODO Ask at most ten girls out on a date
* Money
The main goal here was to double my income and I'm happy to say that I'm
more than halfway there. I got a raise at work which helped a lot so now
all I have to do is to increase my other income sources and I should be
good.
On starting a business, I'm not sure how I feel about this now because
multiple people are trying to start a business with me and I'm not sure
if it counts if I don't own all of the business.
I'll think more about that and report next month.
** Actions progress
*** DONE Create client acquisition habit in LMS
*** DONE Get a salary increase
*** DOING Start a business
* Other skills
I learned some guitar but I fell off after week two and I haven't
touched my guitar since.
On the UI/UX side I have learned nothing.
I'll try again this month, but if it doesn't work I might have to pick
just one to focus on.
** Actions progress
*** DONE Create UI/UX Design learning habit in LMS
*** DONE Create Guitar learning habit in LMS
*** DOING Finish three design projects
*** TODO Learn how to play three classical guitar pieces
