This was an okay month.
Unfortunately I haven't made much progress on my goals since February.
I have my reasons but I don't want to go into it too much.
I talk a bit about it in the productivity section though.
For those same reasons, there's no March review.
I'm fully back now so May should be a good month.

* Health
According to my spreadsheet I have gained 0.9KG.
I'm not happy with this but clearly I can't be doing what I've been
doing.
I am already exercising so I'll be doing a full overhaul of my diet instead.
My current diet is a combination of food from my mother's restaurant and
food I order from other restaurants I like.
I'll be dusting off my recipe book and start cooking for myself more.
Mentally, I am better.
I'm more relaxed and happier in general and I intend to keep it that
way.

* Productivity
I was productive in the sense that I did a lot of things.
Most of it was client work but I'm done with most of that now.
I had a negative experience with a client and I've learned a lot from
it.
So I won't be taking any client work until I've documented what I
learned and incorporate it into how I will handle future clients.
In terms of my actions below, I was 0% productive.
That will change this month.
