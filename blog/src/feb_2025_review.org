This was a rough month.
I said yes to too many things.
I was overwhelmed and my sleep was poor.
Understandably, my productivity and habits suffered.
As did my physical and mental health.

* Health
According to my spreadsheet I have lost exactly 1KG.
It's better than last month, but it's not great in the grand scheme of
things.
I didn't exercise consistently and I regularly pulled all-nighters.
On the bright side, I can do pushups now.

* Productivity
I was more productive than last month.
However, most of my time was spent on client work and not my personal
projects or digital products.
Going forward I will be saying no to most client work.
I'll also be decreasing the limit of the projects I can take on to one
from three.
** Actions progress
*** DOING Finish three personal projects [0/3]
*** TODO Build three digital products
* Programming
I have made more progress here than I did last month.
I'm still not done with [[https://threejs-journey.com/][ThreeJS Journey]] but I think I'm at the point
where I can start making cool stuff with it.
I'll keep pushing here.
** Actions progress
*** DONE Create leetcode habit in LMS
*** DOING Finish [[https://threejs-journey.com/][ThreeJS Journey]] course
*** TODO Finish programming boost
*** TODO Read [[https://interpreterbook.com/][Writing An Interpreter In Go]]
* Relationships
I have made zero progress here, again.
** Actions progress
*** DOING Go out with friends at least ten times [0/10]
*** TODO Ask at most ten girls out on a date
* Money
I've thought about and I think I'm just going to start my own business.
I liked the ideas of the others and I may still work with them but it
just didn't feel like "mine". So I'll start my own business and see how
it goes.
** Actions progress
*** DONE Create client acquisition habit in LMS
*** DONE Get a salary increase
*** DOING Start a business
* Other skills
I have made zero progress here.
** Actions
*** DONE Create UI/UX Design learning habit in LMS
