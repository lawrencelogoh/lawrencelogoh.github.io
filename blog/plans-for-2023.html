    <h1 id="name"> Plans for 2023  </h1>
    

<article>
<p>
The basic idea behind this year is to play to my strengths and work on my weaknesses. Min-maxing essentially. 
A lot of these things are not checklist items that I can just list and tick off.
They require step-by-step plans which I will make and follow.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-productivity" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="productivity">Productivity</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
I already have a system that I use to manage my life. It's just a folder of org files that I like to call my LMS(Life Management System).
I plan to rethink and clearly define this system and some of the other systems that I use in conjunction with it.
I think doing that will boost my productivity.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-relationships" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="relationships">Relationships</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
When it comes to relationships, I'm very passive.
I generally don't call or text people until they call me and I don't check on people I care about.
When I talk to people about how they do it, they say it just comes naturally to them.
For whatever reason, that doesn't happen for me. But I want to do it, so I'm going to be more active and intentional about my relationships.
This will involve not only calling and checking on people more, but also planning and scheduling activities to spend more time with the people I care about.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-programming" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="programming">Programming</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
I know some programming languages but I don't think I know any of them well enough.
So the plan is to become good at two of them at least. 
Python and Go seem like the obvious choices so I'll go with them for now.
While I do that, I also plan to at least check out Rust and Zig and see how I like them.
When it comes to programming domains, I want to become a well-rounded backend developer and improve my frontend skills.
Beyond that, I will be trying out other domains like mobile development and OS development(for fun).
What this will generally look like is, building a lot of projects that are not necessarily useful to the general public. But if I can do that, I will.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-money" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="money">Money</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
I've lived a very comfortable life.
Because of that, I haven't had to think about money until now.
I want to do a lot of cool stuff but money seems to be the thing that I lack to do them.
So this year, I'm going to focus on making money.
My humble goal, for now, is at least an average income of $2000/month by the end of the year.
I know I can make more than that, but I live in Ghana, and most employers don't pay that much.

<div id="outline-container-other-skills" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="other-skills">Other skills</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
As you can already tell, my writing is shit. 
I want to write a book next year about a concept I'm chewing on, so it has to be improved.
Another big one is some type of artistic outlet that is not writing. The ones I'm most attracted to right now are drawing and the electric guitar. 
</p>

<p>
This is a non-exhaustive list but these are the non-negotiables. They come first before everything else.
</p>

<p>
Happy New Year.
