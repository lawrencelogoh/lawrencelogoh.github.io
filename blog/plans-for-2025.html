<p>
The general idea this year is to make and do things.
I plan a lot but I end up finishing very little. 
As such, I've decided to reduce the amount of things I do so that I can
finish more things.
This time, I will share the actions for each section.

<h2 id="health">Health</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
My weight is the main problem here, so the main thing I will be focusing
on this year is my diet and eating habits. Exercise will be a secondary
focus and I'm sure it'll also help a bit. The main reason I'm including
exercise is that it makes me feel good.

I've always known that willpower is finite but I acted as if mine wasn't.
Limiting the things I do within a day has been helpful so I'm going to
keep doing that.
The main thing I will be focusing on here is finishing personal
projects. 
Last year I started more than twenty personal projects but I finished
maybe two. 
I'm going to try to not start any more personal projects and finish some
of the current projects instead.

I spent a lot of time programming last year.
Most of it was not focused practice or learning though, I was just
trying to get things to work.
I learned new programming languages but I'm still not good at any of
them.
I started learning OCaml for advent of code so I'll still keep learning
that but I won't be learning any new programming languages this year.

<p>
I was a bit more proactive in my relationships last year.
This was a big improvement from previous years.
This year I want to spend more time with people I care about.
There are a lot of cool people I know that I want to be closer to but I
didn't make time for them.
On the romantic side, I wasn't as proactive as I could've been so I'm
going to do that this year.

This list seems more doable than what I had last year. I also made the
mistake of adding some goals to my plans but because they weren't very
actionable I didn't <i>do</i> anything.
</p>


<p>
There are other things I want to do but they don't fit properly into any
of the categories and some are a bit sensitive so I'll keep those to
myself.
If I end up doing them, I will post about it on <a href="https://x.com/lawrencelogoh">my Twitter</a> and/or
<a href="https://instagram.com/larrylogoh">Instagram</a>.

<p>
Happy New Year.
