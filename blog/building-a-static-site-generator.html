What I was using is <a href="https://github.com/lawrencelogoh/lawrencelogoh.github.io/blob/921d8d1012f73c6298b7d5412404b0f7b2a33ed/build">a badly written bash script that depends on pup and pandoc</a>.
I don't mind the pandoc dependency too much as I have it on all my systems anyway. 
But the script is messy and I'd rather have something cleaner.

<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
Most of the static site generators I've seen like Hugo and Jekyll seem too complicated for me.
I'm not saying I can't use them, I just felt some friction and thought it would be cool to build my own.
</p>

<p>
My requirements for the current script were:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Must have as few dependencies as possible.</li>
<li>Must work on UNIX/UNIX-like systems</li>
<li>Must generate an RSS file with all blog posts</li>
<li>Must arrange blog posts by date</li>
</ul>

<p>
I didn't put too much thought into how the old script worked.
I started by writing a function that compiles the markdown files of my blog posts.
Everything else came after that.
Whenever I hit a roadblock, I looked for a program that could help me.
In the end, I had a hacky script that worked but I wasn't proud of it.
I also started to run into problems when I wanted to add new functionality or change something.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/lawrencelogoh/lawrencelogoh.github.io/blob/9c27fe701fb522f936147f5ad5fbd01a02f7ad13/build">The current script</a> is not as bad.
The way that it works is, it assumes every directory(including the root directory) has an <code>src</code> subdirectory.
It compiles every markdown file in the <code>src</code> subdirectories to HTML files that live in the directory itself.
To get away with not creating an <code>index.html</code> I create an <code>index.md</code> instead and that gets compiled like every other markdown file.
That's the core of how it works.
If you want the details, read the script.
</p>


<p>
I'm happy with how it works right now but there's a minor annoyance I have with it.
The blog posts are arranged according to their dates by putting the date
in the file name.
</p>

<p>
<i>Yuck</i>.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
I tried using an associative array to do it at first, but I found it difficult to sort the dates with the sort program.
I'll figure it out eventually.

I have since implemented what I call "ghetto sorting". It's not pretty but it works
